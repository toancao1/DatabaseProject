	</strong>
	<p>Food is an important aspect of many people’s lives,
		especially during this difficult time we are currently having.
		Many people are missing out on the great cuisine outside.
		To combat the hunger for great tasting food, we have decided to
		create a food delivery service. We will be collaborating with many
		different restaurants in the area to accomplish this.</p>
	<p>Delivery services get flooded with requests every minute therefore
		it is key we store the Customer’s identification, order details and employee details of these orders in a
		database.
	<p>The customers will visit our webpage and be greeted by a wide variety of products from our menu. They will then
		decide on which product they want and check out. After submitting their order everything will be placed into a
		table in the database. The Restaurant entity may contain one or more stores the product the customer will check
		out. During checkout, their identity will be stored into our Customer entity so that we can successfully deliver
		their food. Their order will then be placed into our Order entity so that we know what they ordered. Finally,
		their order will be completed by one or more employees. The Restaurant entity stores the product when the user
		wants to purchase that product. </p>
