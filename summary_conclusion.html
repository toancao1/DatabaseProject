	<h3 id="Summary">Summary of Experience</h3>
	<p style="text-indent: 50px" id="SummaryParagraph">For this group project, we used PhpMyAdmin and Notepad++ or other
		software to create a database for our website. Some problems we faced are making sure the PHP scripts are
		connected and working well with the website. An example is the login page is working but the register page is
		not adding a new user or displaying the correct permissions. The image handling is displaying the data correctly
		in the database. In future projects, we could ask for help if we are stuck to avoid any problems and
		double-check the php scripts as well as phpMyAdmin to make sure the tables match. </p>
	<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
	<p id="ConclusionParagraph">Our group has decided to do a project on a food delivery service database. Each customer
		will receive a unique id that matches a specific product number. Once a customer places an order for a product,
		it will be stored in the database connecting to the restaurant. We want to maximize efficiency and ensure smooth
		delivery for food to our customers. Edits were made to the EER and physical database for part 3 and 4. We
		updated our website to include different permissions as an administrator, registered user, etc. We also included
		multimedia and different operations like update and delete data in the tables.</p>
